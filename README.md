This is where we will work on visualization and user interface for John Goldsmith's Linguistica project.

HTML and Javascript live in the 'webui' folder:
- *index.html* is a webapp with a prototype of the graph visualization software
- *graphutils.js* contains JS logic for the webapp
- *d3.js* is a copy of the D3 source. Included in full for inspection or changes.
- *package.json* is a manifest for node-webkit packaging.
- *Makefile* contains some helpful shortcuts for publishing as a webpage or a node-webkit program. Must be edited for your local environment.
