These are some demo visualizations / user interfaces for [John Goldsmith](https://github.com/JohnAGoldsmith)'s [Linguistica](http://linguistica.uchicago.edu/publications.html) project. [graph-contexts](graph-contexts) and [webui](webui) are some older demos of graph, sankey, and hive plots. [contexts-app](contexts-app) contains the most up-to-date software, and is intended to be a more full-featured software package that will allow for interactive data visualization of linguistic data.
