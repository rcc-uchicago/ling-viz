## Large-scale Graph Viz

Alternative representations for large-scale graph data:

* [hive plots](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/hive/)
* [hierarchical edge bundling](http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111116/bundle.html)
* [matrix diagrams](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/miserables/)
* [chord diagrams](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/uberdata/)

Why? As Mike Bostock notes:

> Many methods of graph drawing, such as force layouts, do not assign
> intrinsically-meaningful positions to nodes: the position is only
> approximate, in the hope that related nodes appear nearby. While intuitive,
> these methods arguably make poor use of the most effective visual channel
> (that is, position), and in the worst case produce an indecipherable
> hairball.

* [Mapping a million connections](http://www.iwillreply.com/prototypes/unileverforcedirectedgraph/) - WebGL experiment demonstrating how large-scale graph data can be rendered in 3-dimensions and how a subset of nodes can be highlighted based on some nodal attribute.


## IPython Notebook

The [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/notebook/notebook.html) is an open-source, web-based interactive computing environment that enables users to create documents that combine live code and data with text, equations, plots and HTML.

See the [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/) to peruse example notebooks.

[This article](http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/01/ipython-a-unified-environment-for-interactive-data-analysis.html) provides a quick intro to IPython and describes how it's become a unified environment for interactive data analysis.

For an in-depth tutorial introduction, see [IPython In Depth](http://strataconf.com/strata2014/public/schedule/detail/31982): a recent 3-hour tutorial given by IPython core developers.  Full tutorial [content](https://github.com/ipython/ipython-in-depth) and [videos](http://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/strata-conference-santa/9781491900321/part04.html) are available.
