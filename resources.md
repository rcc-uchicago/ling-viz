# Resources

Misc. tools and resources for large-scale graph visualization and analysis.

* [Graph Rendering Performance](http://nad.webfactional.com/ntap/graphscale/) - web app to test rendering performance for different size random graphs with X nodes and 2X edges

* [JS Graph Drawing Libraries](https://github.com/anvaka/graph-drawing-libraries) - list of available options, though [Alchemy.js](https://github.com/GraphAlchemist/Alchemy) is missing.

* [Mapping a million connections](http://www.iwillreply.com/prototypes/unileverforcedirectedgraph/) - WebGL experiment demonstrating how large-scale graph data can be rendered in 3-dimensions and how a subset of nodes can be highlighted based on some nodal attribute.
